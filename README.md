# Rhythm Keeper 🕰️ & Money Grower 💰

This repo holds two connected systems:

1. **Rhythm Keeper** → my *daily/weekly/monthly/annual rhythm memory*  
   - Reminders for meds, PT/OT, house care, business anchors, celebrations, cultural traditions.  
   - Keeps my life structured and cycle-aware.  

2. **Money Grower** → my *finance & rebate engine*  
   - Stores details for rebate programs, cashback links, referral codes, marketplace rules, Amazon approvals, and credit card perks.  
   - Keeps money-making information organized separately from daily rhythms.
